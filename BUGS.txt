Parser.hs: Parser is broken, probably as a consequence of the change from parsing words as a sequence of alphaNum chars to a sequence of any char that is not chars like '[', ']', etc. See commit:

https://github.com/LemmingAvalanche/Stabl/commit/9822c4b40629fba2d8b8aa205b11071d3af50411

Now, when trying to parse stabl experession, the parser will store characters like ']' as words, while it really should parse them as containing quotations.
