A dynamic concatenative language that *aspires* to be highly interactive; the programmer should be able to prod and poke at the program as much as he wants, with as little friction as possible. It should also have a conceptually simple implementation that is simple to build upon; ideally a simple core implementation that can be extended in Stabl itself later, even if that extension has to be done in an ad-hoc manner. Lastly, though it should be highly interactive, it should also be possible to sacrifice interactivity for some static guarantees, when that is desirable. An example of this is optional typing; opt-in static typing in dynamic languages.

Background

This was originally a term project in the course INF225 (fall 2014) at the University of Bergen. The project was then (loosely) about making a Forth-like language.
